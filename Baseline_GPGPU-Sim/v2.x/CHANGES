CHANGE LOG:

Version 2.1.3b versus 2.1.2b:
- Fixed parameter offset alignment for complex data types such as vector types
  and structs.  Before this fix, passing a struct or vector type as a kernel
  parameter may not work.  
- Updated the OpenCL function declarations to be compatible with the OpenCL
  header files distributed via CUDA 3.1 or later.
- Explicitly enabled some boolean simulator options in the provided Quadro
  configuration file to clarify the value of those options.  
- Fixed a bug that broke the number of memory accesses generated per ptx line
  statistic.

Version 2.1.2b versus 2.1.1b:
- Better 1D texture support
- bar.sync timing change for compatibility with NVIDIA hardware
  (release barrier when all warps reach barrier, irrespective of
  divergence state). Functional simulation mode disabled to
  implement the expected barrier behavior under branch divergence
- Refactored memory stage
- Limited miss status holding registers
- Experimental support for running on Mac OS X
- Register bank conflict modeling (see MICRO-42 tutorial)
- Changed files to C++
- Updated makefiles
- Various improvements to aerialvision
- Simulation speed improvement
- Various minor fixes

Version 2.1.1b versus 2.1.0b:
- Added support for OpenCL (requires OpenCL driver from NVIDIA)
- Added performance visualizer tool
- Added manual documenting usage of the simulator (see doc directory)
- Added configuration file for Quadro FX5800 (see configs directory)
- Simultaneous release of benchmarks from ISPASS 2009 paper (separate download)
- Improved shared memory bank conflict modeling
- Improved default mapping of local memory accesses to global address space 
- Added interconnect concentration modeling (to approximate effect of a TPC)
- Added support for GPU-to-GPU memory copies (same GPU), timing not modeled
- SimpleScalar code (for command line parsing and functional simulation of 
  memory) removed.
- PTX support for vector operands in mov instruction
- Bug fixes
   - stack overwrite bug fix (with thanks to Jake Adriaens)
   - interconnect clock domain crossing "bottleneck" bug (was not removing
     traffic quickly enough going from memory to shader cores)
   - immediate post dominator detection (affected eigenvalues SDK benchmark)
   - CTA/core calculation error with PTX containing calls and returns
   - global symbol lookup error when building with multiple .cu files
- Other general improvements and bugfixes

Version 2.1.0b versus 2.0b:
- Added support for parsing and functionally simulating up to CUDA 2.2 
  generated PTX
- Added dynamic warp formation timing model (see MICRO'07, ACM TACO'09 papers)
- Updated gpgpusim.config and mesh in benchmark subdirectories to be similar to
  ISPASS 2009 paper baseline configurations
- Added OpenGL interoperability support
- Added support for parsing embedded PTX files without requiring recompilation 
  (suggested by Gregory Diamos)
- Improved support for texture filtering (linear mode for 2D, closer agreement
  to hardware for 2D point sampling where sample points are close to texel
  boundaries)
- Benchmark examples updated to version from CUDA 2.2 SDK (NOTE: these will not 
  compile with earlier CUDA installations. However, GPGPU-Sim should still work 
  with applications written for older versions of CUDA.)
- Fixed splash screen: was reporting incorrect version
- Fixed bug comparing strings in basic block formation code
- Fixed bug with additional basic block (which lead to incorrect postdominator 
  analysis on some benchmarks with recent versions of CUDA)
- Fixed "warning: "/*" within comment" when building.
- "Other general improvements"
